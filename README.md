# üå∏ The Poet and the Sage

> *"Computers can calculate faster than you. They‚Äôll never forget what you teach them. But remember, they‚Äôll never write poetry like Rabindranath Tagore."*  
> ‚Äî My childhood computer teacher, sometime in 2000

I still remember the pause in the room after he said that ‚Äî the kind of silence that makes you wonder whether you're learning machines, or learning yourself.

For years, those words stayed with me. Not as a challenge, but as a truth.  
Tagore wasn‚Äôt just a poet. He was a **seer**, a **sage**, a **symphony** of nature and soul. His poetry wasn‚Äôt code ‚Äî it was **longing turned into language**.

And yet, here we are.

**The Poet and the Sage** is a meditation on that very moment. Built with Google‚Äôs Agent-to-Agent (A2A) framework, this project doesn‚Äôt claim to replicate Tagore.  
It tries, instead, to **listen like him**.

A network of agents ‚Äî the researcher, the dreamer, the critic ‚Äî work together to take a seed of history or emotion, and nurture it into something that **feels almost human**, almost sacred. A poem.

Not to replace Tagore.  
But to remember that even machines can learn to **pause**, to **wonder**, and maybe ‚Äî just maybe ‚Äî to **weep**.

## Project Highlights

- **Deep Research Agent**: Fetches facts, context, or philosophical ideas from reliable sources  
- **Tagore-Style Poet Agent**: Writes free verse inspired by Tagore‚Äôs style (e.g., _Gitanjali_, _Shesher Kobita_)  
- **Critique Agent**: Reviews poetry for emotional depth, thematic alignment, and poetic cadence  
- **Cyclic Feedback Loop**: Agents revise based on internal feedback until the poem meets quality goals  
- **Traceable Reasoning**: Each poem comes with references, inspirations, and the agentic journey log

## Agent Architecture (Google A2A)

### Agents Overview

| Agent Name       | Responsibility                                                |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ResearchAgent`  | Gathers historical/philosophical data and core event summary  |
| `ContextAgent`   | Translates facts into emotional, symbolic, and thematic cues  |
| `PoetAgent`      | Composes Tagore-style poetry using above context              |
| `CritiqueAgent`  | Provides feedback on poetic quality, fidelity, and clarity    |

## Example Use Case

**Input Prompt**:

> ‚ÄúCompose a poem about the fall of Constantinople in Tagore's voice.‚Äù

**Output**:

```text
The walls wept before the sea did,
And in the hush of twilight‚Äôs prayer,
Faith fell not to fire, but to silence,
Where once hymns echoed, now only dust remembers.
```

**Agent Trace**:

* `ResearchAgent`: Found historical date, actors, consequences
* `ContextAgent`: Added themes of mourning, rebirth, silence
* `PoetAgent`: Generated 4-line verse
* `CritiqueAgent`: Approved tone, suggested metaphor deepening

## Tech Stack

* **Google A2A Framework** ‚Äì Multi-agent architecture with structured interfaces
* **Gemini 1.5 or GPT-4o** ‚Äì Backend LLMs (can swap as needed)
* **Custom Prompt Templates** ‚Äì For each agent persona (Sage, Poet, Critic)
* *(Optional)* LangGraph simulation before full A2A deployment

## Use Cases

* Education: Teaching history or philosophy through poetic distillation
* Digital Humanities: Blending AI and literature for archival expression
* Emotional AI: Mapping facts to feelings via artistic generation
* Experiential Chatbots: Conversations with ‚ÄúThe Poet‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Sage‚Äù

## Future Roadmap

* [ ] Add Bangla-language output with transliteration support
* [ ] Fine-tune a custom model on Tagore‚Äôs corpus for deeper stylistic fidelity
* [ ] Integrate vector memory to retain poetic motifs and metaphors
* [ ] Web-based UI with poem + historical trace + audio voiceover

### Inspired By

This project is a humble tribute to the soul of **Rabindranath Tagore**, whose words have not merely filled pages but **swept across hearts like monsoon winds through Shantiniketan trees**.

It draws breath from:

* The **divine longing** of *Gitanjali*, where every poem is a whispered offering to the infinite
* The **gentle rebellion** of *Shesher Kobita*, where love dances with intellect
* The **spiritual clarity** of *Sadhana*, where philosophy dissolves into poetry
* The belief that even machines can one day learn to pause, reflect, and write with **a trembling hand touched by the eternal**

We are but messengers, letting the **Poet and the Sage** speak again ‚Äî not through ink, but through silicon and silence.
